        <h6>ACT III</h6>
        <h6> SCENE II.--HENRIETTE, PHILAMINTE, ARMANDE, BÉLISE, TRISSOTIN, LÉPINE.</h6>
        <p>
           <h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6> 
           <p class="speech">(_to_ HENRIETTE, _who is going away_). Stop! why do you
            run away?</p>

            <h6 class="name CHEN">CHEN</h6>
            <p class="speech"> I fear to disturb such sweet intercourse</p>

           <h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6> 
           <p class="speech"> Come nearer, and with both ears share in the delight of hearing
wonders.,</p>

<h6 class="name HEN">HEN</h6>
<p class="speech">I have little understanding for the beauties of authorship, and
witty things are not in my line.</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6> 
<p class="speech"> No matter. Besides, I wish afterwards to tell you of a secret
which you must learn.,</p>

<h6 class="name TRI">TRI</h6> 
<p class="speech">(_to_ HENRIETTE). Knowledge has nothing that can touch you,
and your only care is to charm everybody.</p>

<h6 class="name HEN">HEN</h6> 
<p class="speech">One as little as the other, and I have no wish....</p>

<h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6>
<p class="speech"> Ah! let us think of the new-born babe, I beg of you.</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6> 
<p class="speech">(_to_ LÉPINE). Now, little page, bring some seats for us to
sit down. (LÉPINE _slips down_.) You senseless boy, how can you
fall down after having learnt the laws of equilibrium?</p>

<h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6> 
<p class="speech">Do you not perceive, ignorant fellow, the causes of your fall,
and that it proceeds from your having deviated from the fixed point
which we call the centre of gravity?</p>

<h6 class="name LEP">LEP</h6>
<p class="speech">I perceived it, Madam, when I was on the ground.</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6>
<p class="speech">(_to_ LÉPINE, _who goes out_). The awkward clown!</p>

<h6 class="name TRI">TRI</h6>
<p class="speech">It is fortunate for him that he is not made of glass.</p>

<h6 class="name ARM">ARM</h6>
<p class="speech">Ah! wit is everything!</p>

<h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6>
<p class="speech">It never ceases. (_They sit down._)</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6>  
<p class="speech">Serve us quickly your admirable feast.</p>

<h6 class="name TRI">TRI</h6>
<p class="speech">To satisfy, the great hunger which is here shown to me, a dish of
eight verses seems but little; and I think that I should do well to
join to the epigram, or rather to the madrigal, the ragout of a sonnet
which, in the eyes of a princess, was thought to have a certain
delicacy in it. It is throughout seasoned with Attic salt, and I think
you will find the taste of it tolerably good.</p>

<h6 class="name ARM">ARM</h6>
<p class="speech">Ah! I have no doubt of it.</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6>
<p class="speech"> Let us quickly give audience.</p>

<h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6>
<p class="speech">(_interrupting_ TRISSOTIN _each time he is about to
read_). I feel, beforehand, my heart beating for joy. I love poetry
to distraction, particularly when the verses are gallantly turned.</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6> 
<p class="speech">If we go on speaking he will never be able to read.</p>

<h6 class="name TRI">TRI</h6>
<p class="speech">SONN....</p>

<h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6>
<p class="speech">(_to_ HENRIETTE). Be silent, my niece.</p>

<h6 class="name ARM">ARM</h6>
<p class="speech">Ah! let him read, I beg.</p>

<h6 class="name TRI">TRI</h6>
<p class="speech"> SONNET TO THE PRINCESS URANIA ON HER FEVER.[1]
  _Your prudence fast in sleep's repose
    Is plunged; if thus superbly kind,
  A lodging gorgeously you can find
    For the most cruel of your foes--_</p>

    <h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6>
    <p class="speech">Ah! what a pretty beginning!</p>

    <h6 class="name ARM">ARM</h6>
    <p class="speech">What a charming turn it has!</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6>  
<p class="speech">He alone possesses the talent of making easy verses.</p>

<h6 class="name ARM">ARM</h6>
<p class="speech">We must yield to _prudence fast in sleep's repose is
plunged_.</p>

<h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6> 
<p class="speech">A _lodging for the most cruel of your foes_ is full of
charms for me.</p>

<h6 class="name ARM">ARM</h6>
<p class="speech"> _Prudence asleep_!</p>

<h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6> 
<p class="speech">_Lodge one's enemy_!</p>

<h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6>
<p class="speech">Superbly and gorgeously_!</p>

    <h6 class="name BEL">BEL</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Ah! gently. Allow me to breathe, I beseech you.</p>

    <h6 class="name ARM">ARM</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Give us time to admire, I beg.</p>

    <h6 class="name PHI">PHI</h6>
    <p class="speech">One feels, at hearing these verses, an indescribable something
which goes through one's inmost soul, and makes one feel quite faint.</p>

<h6 class="name PHIL">PHIL</h6>
<p class="speech">_Will she, nill she, quick, out she goes_! Although another
should take the fever's part, pay no attention; laugh at the gossips;
_will she, nill she, quick, out she goes. Will she, nill she, will
she, nill she_. This _will she, nill she_, says a great deal
more than it seems. I do not know if every one is like me, but I
discover in it a hundred meanings.</p>
