        <p>
           <li>PHI. (_to_ HENRIETTE, _who is going away_). Stop! why do you
            run away?</li> 

           <li>CHEN. I fear to disturb such sweet intercourse.</li>

            <li>PHI. Come nearer, and with both ears share in the delight of hearing
wonders.</li>

<li>HEN. I have little understanding for the beauties of authorship, and
witty things are not in my line.</li>

<li>PHI. No matter. Besides, I wish afterwards to tell you of a secret
which you must learn.</li>

<li>TRI. (_to_ HENRIETTE). Knowledge has nothing that can touch you,
and your only care is to charm everybody.</li>

<li>HEN. One as little as the other, and I have no wish....</li>

<li>BEL. Ah! let us think of the new-born babe, I beg of you.</li>

<li>PHI. (_to_ LÉPINE). Now, little page, bring some seats for us to
sit down. (LÉPINE _slips down_.) You senseless boy, how can you
fall down after having learnt the laws of equilibrium?</li>

<li>BEL. Do you not perceive, ignorant fellow, the causes of your fall,
and that it proceeds from your having deviated from the fixed point
which we call the centre of gravity?</li>

<li>LEP. I perceived it, Madam, when I was on the ground.</li>

<li>PHI. (_to_ LÉPINE, _who goes out_). The awkward clown!</li>

<li>TRI. It is fortunate for him that he is not made of glass.</li>

<li>ARM. Ah! wit is everything!</li>

<li>BEL. It never ceases. (_They sit down._)</li>

<li>PHI. Serve us quickly your admirable feast.</li>

<li>TRI. To satisfy, the great hunger which is here shown to me, a dish of
eight verses seems but little; and I think that I should do well to
join to the epigram, or rather to the madrigal, the ragout of a sonnet
which, in the eyes of a princess, was thought to have a certain
delicacy in it. It is throughout seasoned with Attic salt, and I think
you will find the taste of it tolerably good.</li>

<li>ARM. Ah! I have no doubt of it.</li>

<li>PHI. Let us quickly give audience.</li>

<li>BEL. (_interrupting_ TRISSOTIN _each time he is about to
read_). I feel, beforehand, my heart beating for joy. I love poetry
to distraction, particularly when the verses are gallantly turned.</li>

<li>PHI. If we go on speaking he will never be able to read.</li>

<li>TRI. SONN....</li>

<li>BEL. (_to_ HENRIETTE). Be silent, my niece.</li>

<li>ARM. Ah! let him read, I beg.</li>

<li>TRI. SONNET TO THE PRINCESS URANIA ON HER FEVER.[1]
  _Your prudence fast in sleep's repose
    Is plunged; if thus superbly kind,
  A lodging gorgeously you can find
    For the most cruel of your foes--_</li>

<li>[1]
[The sonnet is not of Molière's invention, but is to be found in
_Les Oeuvres galantes en prose et en vers de M. Cotin_, Paris,
1663. It is called, _Sonnet à Mademoiselle de Longueville, à présent
Duchesse de Nemours, sur sa fièvre quarte_. As, of necessity, the
translation given above is not very literal, I append the original.</li>

<li> "Votre prudence est endormie,
     De traiter magnifiquement,
     Et de loger superbement,
   Votre plus cruelle ennemie;

   Faites-la sortir quoi qu'on die,
     De votre riche appartement,
     Où cette ingrate insolemment
   Attaque votre belle vie!

   Quoi! sans respecter votre rang,
   Elle se prend à votre sang,
     Et nuit et jour vous fait outrage!

   Si vous la conduisez aux bains,
     Sans la marchander davantage,
   Noyez-la de vos propres mains."</li>

   <li>The _die_ of _quoi qu'on die_ was the regular form in
Molière's time, and had nothing archaic about it. This is sufficiently
true of "Will she, nill she" (compare Shakespeare's "And, will you,
nill you, I will marry you") to excuse its use here.]</li>

<li>BEL. Ah! what a pretty beginning!</li>

<li>ARM. What a charming turn it has!</li>

<li>PHI. He alone possesses the talent of making easy verses.</li>

<li>ARM. We must yield to _prudence fast in sleep's repose is
plunged_.</li>

<li>BEL. A _lodging for the most cruel of your foes_ is full of
charms for me.</li>

<li>PHI. I like _superbly_ and _gorgeously_; these two adverbs
joined together sound admirably.</li>

<li>BEL. Let us hear the rest.</li>

<li>TRI.
  _Your prudence fast in sleep's repose
    Is plunged; if thus superbly kind,
  A lodging gorgeously you can find
    For the most cruel of your foes_</li>

    <li>ARM. _Prudence asleep_!</li>

    <li>BEL. _Lodge one's enemy_!</li>

    <li>PHI. _Superbly and gorgeously_!</li>

    <li>TRI.
  _Will she, nill she, quick, out she goes!
    From your apartment richly lined,
  Where that ingrate's outrageous mind
    At your fair life her javelin throws_.</li>

    <li>BEL. Ah! gently. Allow me to breathe, I beseech you.</li>

    <li>ARM. Give us time to admire, I beg.</li>

    <li>PHI. One feels, at hearing these verses, an indescribable something
which goes through one's inmost soul, and makes one feel quite faint.</li>

<li>ARM.
  _Will she, nill she, quick, out she goes
    From your apartment richly lined_.
How prettily _rich apartment_ is said here, and with what wit the
metaphor is introduced!</li>

<li>PHI. _Will she, nill she, quick, out she goes!_ Ah! in what
admirable taste that _will she, nill she_, is! To my mind the
passage is invaluable.</li>

<li>ARM. My heart is also in love with _will she, nill she_.</li>

<li>BEL. I am of your opinion; _will she, nill she_, is a happy
expression.</li>

<li>ARM. I wish I had written it.</li>

<li>BEL. It is worth a whole poem!</li>

<li>PHI. But do you, like me, understand thoroughly the wit of it?</li>

<li>ARM. _and_ BEL. Oh! oh</li>

<li>PHIL. _Will she, nill she, quick, out she goes_! Although another
should take the fever's part, pay no attention; laugh at the gossips;
_will she, nill she, quick, out she goes. Will she, nill she, will
she, nill she_. This _will she, nill she_, says a great deal
more than it seems. I do not know if every one is like me, but I
discover in it a hundred meanings.</li>
